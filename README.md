# SigneMovie

This is an application that I built for my sister to make stop motion movies. It uses the platypus application which bundles a custom ruby script that utilizes ffmpeg. An ffmpeg binary is included, so there is no need to have it installed.

# Installation

1. Download the zip [here](https://github.com/soren468/SigneMovie/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip the file
3. Drag the SigneMovie application to your applications folder

# Usage

To use this application you need to put all of your images in one folder. Also, make sure that they are alphanumerically ordered, or the application will not know what order to stitch the pictures together into. You can name the folder what ever you want. Inside the folder there must be a file call fps.txt. This file sets (you guessed it!) frames per second. I know that the number 8 works. So if you are trying another number and it isn't working, try setting it to 8.
